A search for biotechnology papers on PubMed Central, and whether they contain placeholder text.

**To repeat my analysis**: Download the `main_scripts.ipynb` Jupyter notebook and execute the code cells. This notebook uses the `requests` and `json` libraries to fetch full-texts of explicitly the _methods_ and _discussion_ sections from papers. There were more than 8,800 results for the years 2018 through 2022.

I also ran searches for phrases like "TK" (which means _to come_ in journalism parlance), "Lorem" and others. None of these phrases seem to have turned up legitimate 'hits,' though I didn't check all of the papers closely.
